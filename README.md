Air 408 TSEBE

Next-Generation Technology for Live Events

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Air 408 TSEBE, a cutting-edge project designed to transform the future of event technology.

Project Overview

Air 408 TSEBE is focused on autonomous, high-performance event technology, integrating advanced power management, real-time synchronization, and innovative control systems.

Our core objectives include:

Optimized Power Solutions â€“ Developing efficient UPS and battery management systems.

Advanced Control Mechanisms â€“ Implementing AI-driven synchronization and automation.

Scalability for Large Events â€“ Engineering solutions adaptable to various live performance environments.


Current Development Goals

1. Finalizing the UPS System â€“ Integrating a 24V 120Ah LiFePOâ‚„ battery for uninterrupted power.


2. Enhancing Synchronization â€“ Implementing real-time control algorithms for seamless operation.


3. Optimizing Power Efficiency â€“ Developing a custom DC-DC buck converter for system stability.


4. Scaling for Large Events â€“ Testing adaptability for different event applications.



Technology Stack

Hardware: LiFePOâ‚„ Batteries | Ant BMS | Custom DC-DC Converters

Software: Python | AI/ML Frameworks | Advanced Control Systems

Integration: Autonomous Synchronization | Frequency-Based Control Algorithms


Business Model

Air 408 TSEBE will operate on a rental-based model, offering its advanced technology to event organizers worldwide. Instead of direct sales, we will establish rental hubs in key event locations to maximize efficiency and profitability.
